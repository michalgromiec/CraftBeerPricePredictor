# CraftBeerPricePrediction

## Aim of this project
The aim of this project is to predict price of craft beers being served at polish craft pubs.

## Problem definition
Craft pubs define prices for beer independently. Assume some pubs are positioning their prices higher than average - we would like to:
* know which pub have prices higher than market (to stop buying beer in those pubs :) )
* know what average price will be in pubs for new beer

## Technologies used
* python 3.7.3
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

## Theories used
* linear corelation
* ANOVA
* logistic regression
* decision tree
* random forest
* MPL neural networks

## Why am I doing this?
This project is finishing project for 6 months Data Science Bootcamp, which I was participant during H1 2019.
